## 🟢 Recently Resolved (Intelligence & Interception)

### 1. Interception Proxy
- **Interception Logic**: Backend relay pauses requests via oneshot channels.
- **UI Editor**: Live header/body modification in the `Intercept` view.
- **Native Effects**: Bi-directional signaling between Rust and React using Tauri events.

### 2. Sequence Orchestration (Advanced Intelligence)
- **Variable Extraction**: Native engine for JSONPath, Header, and Regex capture.
- **Dynamic Substitution**: Cross-request state management using `{{var_name}}` syntax.
- **Sequence Editor**: Full-featured UI for managing complex multi-step logic flows.

### 3. Backend Performance & Stability
- **Rate Limiting**: Successfully throttles scanner requests to prevent target saturation.
- **Architecture**: Trait-based database layer and modularized command structure.

## 🚀 Roadmap 3.0: Deep Analysis & AI

### 1. AI Evidence Enrichment
- **Exploit Narrative**: Automated generation of PoC scripts using LLM context from sequences.
- **Remediation Diffs**: AI-suggested code fixes based on detected logic flaws.

### 2. Advanced Fuzzing
- **Parameter Mining**: Automated discovery of hidden parameters in sequence flows.
- **Type Juggling**: Integrated type-confusion payloads for business logic testing.

## Summary
With Phase 3 complete, Apex is no longer just a scanner; it is a professional workbench for sequence-based logic analysis. The transition from static detection to dynamic interception is fully realized. The focus now shifts to Closing Feature Gaps (Phase 4) and achieving 100/100 Health (Phase 5-7).
